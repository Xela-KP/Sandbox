Sure, let's go through your explanation and make sure the concepts are clear and accurate. I'll also make some minor adjustments for clarity and conciseness.

# Callbacks and Promises

## What is a Callback?

A **callback** is an operation (a block of code or a function) that executes **after** some initial—typically **asynchronous**—operation has completed. The callback is passed as an **argument** to the initial operation and serves as instructions on what to do **after** the **initial operation** is completed.

In simple terms:
A **callback** is an **operation** that executes **after** an **initial operation** completes.

Do **operation1** THEN do **operation2**. Here, **operation2** is the **callback**, and **operation1** is the **initial operation**.

For example:

- **Initial operation**: wait 100ms
- **Callback**: log('successfully waited 100ms')

```js
const callback = () => {
    console.log('successfully waited 100ms');
};
setTimeout(callback, 100);
```

In this example, the **callback** is an operation that outputs "successfully waited 100ms". The **initial operation** is an operation that waits 100ms.

The **callback** is passed as an argument to the **initial operation**. Once the **initial operation** completes, the **callback** will be executed.

## Callbacks with Promises

When working with Promises, callbacks are used in a specific way. A Promise executor function (the function you pass to `new Promise`) takes two functions as arguments: **resolve** and **reject**.

- The **resolve** function executes when the **initial operation** is **successful**.
- The **reject** function executes when the **initial operation** is **unsuccessful**.

For example:

```js
const executor = (resolve, reject) => {
    const isSuccess = true; // some boolean condition
    if (isSuccess) {
        resolve('Operation successful'); // fulfill the promise
    } else {
        reject('Operation failed'); // reject the promise
    }
};
```

## What is a Promise?

A **Promise** is an **object** that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises help us manage asynchronous operations more easily compared to traditional callback-based approaches.

A **Promise** is created using a function (the executor function) as a constructor argument. The executor function takes two arguments: **resolve** and **reject**. The **body** of the executor function is the **initial operation** that executes before a **callback**.

The **resolve** and **reject** functions are both **callback** functions:

- The **resolve** function is a **callback** that is executed if the **initial operation** is successful.
- The **reject** function is a **callback** that is executed if the **initial operation** is unsuccessful.

The actual implementation of the **resolve** function is defined inside the `.then` method of a **Promise**. The actual implementation of the **reject** function is defined inside the `.catch` method of a **Promise**.

### Example

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const isSuccess = true; // some boolean condition
    if (isSuccess) {
        resolve('Operation successful');
    } else {
        reject('Operation failed');
    }
});

promise.then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Output: Operation successful
}).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error); // Output: Operation failed
});
```

## Summary

- **Callbacks** are operations executed after an initial operation completes, often used in asynchronous programming.
- **Promises** are objects that represent the completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous results.
- The **resolve** and **reject** functions in Promises are callbacks used to mark the promise as fulfilled or rejected.

Your understanding of callbacks and promises is correct. The adjustments made help clarify the roles of `resolve` and `reject` within the context of Promises and ensure that the explanations are precise and easy to follow.
